To complete this contribution you should complete the following steps. 

1. Identify the product you find most interesting out of HOTs product suite (https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data)
2. Identify potential users of this product and create a paragraph summary of each potential user (to be submitted)  
3. Pick one of these users to create a user persona for
4. Connect with and briefly interview (max 30mins each) THREE users (eg. HOT community members, end users, HOT partners ) to understand in depth their user needs and current experiences 
5. Create a persona map based on your interview responses (to be submitted)

Valuable skills
- initiative
- problem solving and discovering solutions 
- finding answers, not just asking for them 
- collaboration
- community engagement
- community voice
- creative thinking 
- working with others effectively remotely/online


Some HOT tips:
- slack is a great place to connect with people 
- each of the potential interns may be working on similar things. As such, we want to avoid duplication, so collaboration may need to play a role. 
- There's no problems with people working together. If you find another potential intern working on a similar thing, go ahead make a new friend and work together :) 
- in all open communities listening to and accurately representing the community is critical. So keep this in mind. It should be an echo of the community's voice. Not just one person's opinion. 
- there are not a lot of additional 'rules' here. This is an exercise exploration and creativity. So we want you to be in control of the process. Take it where you believe it should go :) 
- if you are having troubles pinning down busy people's time, you can also read some of the OSM diaries and HOT blogs that may help fill time while you're waiting for people to respond. 
- some people are busy. So please take the time to understand how and when they'd like to be contacted. Keep in mind people are often on different timezones. No one enjoys a work message at 3am on a saturday night.  

So where to start?
- Do you have an OSM account? You should :)
- Have you mapped? Probably should give that a go too :) 
- do you have a GitHub account? You should >
- Do you have HCD experience? If not start here >> [Video link](https://youtu.be/KkUor_NTuDA) 
- the rest is up to you. 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, but keep in mind that initiative is something with high value in remote work, so we're here to support your process
